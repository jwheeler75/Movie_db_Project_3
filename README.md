Hence the "MJD LLC" on app.

## Project Description
This is a full stack React Router JS app.  Uses The Movie Data Base (TMDB) API to list trending movies and to search by user inputs. Two different API endpoints are used to do this.  Deatils can be seen for both trending or search results by clicking on a individual movie image.

## Technologies Used
React JS, React Router, Axios, React-Dom, and React-Router-Dom. Flex Box and Flex Grid for CSS.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP
- Create homepage with 2 React routes to a Trending Movies page and a Search Results page
- Call to API to get data
- Enter user inputs to guide search API endpoint call
- Render data for the max 20 movies returned from Trending Movies or for Serrach Results
- Allow user to interact with all pages.

#### PostMVP

- Create a detail page which displays any movie whose image is clicked on results pages
- Handle/limit extra long movie titles.

## Code Snippet

This code sets the maxium number of characters for the movie title to 40 and adds the ... to the end of the first 40 characters.  The second strips off the month and date from the realease year.

let trendingMovies = [...this.props.allData];
    let movies = trendingMovies.map((movie, index) => {
      if (trendingMovies[index].title.length > 40) {
        let substringTitle = trendingMovies[index].title.substr(0, 40);
        let ellipse = "...";
        movie.title = substringTitle + ellipse;
      }
      let releaseYear = trendingMovies[index].release_date.substr(0, 4);
      movie.release_date = releaseYear;


## Issues and Resolutions

**ERROR**: Getting the same title and year for both the trending and search results.                              
**RESOLUTION**: We mapping over the the trending data array and not the search array data.  Simple copy and paste snag.
